#+TITLE: CXI Jlox Implementation

* Purpose

Here I am trying to learn how to write in Java programming language and
to be able to learn how to create a programming language.

This here is my progress as I follow along with the book 'Crafting Interpreter'
by Robert Nystrom. I have lost my drive, as I have been working on this for too long.
I need break.

I am also making a GNU Guile and Nim implementation. Check them out.

Not anymore.
